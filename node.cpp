// This will hold functions for the node class
// and the graph class.  This class will be the glue that holds the 
// racetrack together along with the ability to track both the drone
// location along with the location of all the obstacles within
// the data structure/race track.  The data structure I will be 
// implementing is a graph connected to a doubly linked list, connected 
// edges and vertices allowing the drone to move in four directions
